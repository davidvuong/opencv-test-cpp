# opencv-test-cpp

**Welcome to opencv-test-cpp!**

This is an exploration repository which by the end, aims to achieve a working OpenCV app using C++. The app will read video from a source, pull out frames, perform some image processing, and store the results onto disk.

In addition, the goal is to make this cross-platform compatible (Windows, Mac, Linux) usig CMake. As such, much of this project will be primarily documentation.

## Installation
